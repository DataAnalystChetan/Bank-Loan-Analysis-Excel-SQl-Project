# Bank Loan Analysis

Silverstone Bank is a fictional Bank. Silverstone Bank is currently facing significant challenges in effectively monitoring its loan portfolio. The existing loan information is unorganized and disparate data sources, which makes it difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of the bank’s lending activities. This has resulted in inefficiencies in tracking loan performance, assessing risk, and ensuring timely repayments.


## Problem Statement

To effectively monitor and assess the performance of Silverstone Bank's lending activities, a comprehensive Bank Loan Report is needed. Currently, the bank lacks an integrated, data-driven approach to track key loan metrics and analyze their changes over time. Without such a report, the bank faces challenges in making informed, data-driven decisions regarding its loan portfolio. This gap hinders the ability to accurately assess the health of the loan portfolio, identify emerging trends, and adjust lending strategies accordingly. The development of this Bank Loan Report will provide valuable insights into loan performance, enabling better decision-making, improving portfolio management, and optimizing lending strategies.
